   - Add your profile image as `images/profile.jpg` (recommended: 800x800px square)
   - Add project images:
     - `images/wikipedia-project.jpg` (1200x800px landscape)
     - `images/todo-project.jpg` (1200x800px landscape)
     - `images/typing-project.jpg` (1200x800px landscape)
   - See `images/IMAGE_SETUP.md` for detailed instructions
   - **Note:** The website will work without images (gradient fallbacks), but adding images makes it look professional!

3. **Open the Website**:
   - Simply open `index.html` in a modern web browser
   - Or use a local server for best experience:
     ```bash
     # Using Python
     python -m http.server 8000
     
     # Using Node.js (http-server)
     npx http-server
     ```

3. **Customization**:
   - Edit `index.html` to update content
   - Modify `styles.css` to change colors and styling
   - Adjust `script.js` for custom animations
