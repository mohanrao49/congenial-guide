IMPORTANT: Resume File Setup

To enable the "Download Resume" functionality:

1. Place your resume PDF file in the images/ folder
2. Name it exactly: resume.pdf
3. The website will automatically link to it for download
4. When users click "Download Resume", the file will download to their device

The resume is located at: images/resume.pdf

Both download buttons in the website are configured:
- Hero section "Download Resume" button
- Contact section "Download Resume" button

Both will download the resume.pdf file from the images folder to the user's device.
