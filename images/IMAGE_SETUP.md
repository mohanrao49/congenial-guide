4. **Quality:** Use high-quality images (at least 72 DPI for web)

## Quick Setup

1. **Add your resume:** Place `resume.pdf` in this `images/` folder
2. Take screenshots of your projects or use design mockups
3. Resize and optimize the images
4. Save them with the exact file names listed above
5. Place all images and resume in this `images/` folder
6. Refresh your website to see the changes!

**Note:** The resume download functionality will work once you add `resume.pdf` to this folder. Both download buttons are already configured!

## Alternative: Using Placeholder Images

If you don't have images ready yet, you can:
- Use placeholder services like `https://via.placeholder.com/1200x800`
- Temporarily use gradient backgrounds (already implemented as fallback)
- Add your images later when ready

The website will still work without images, but adding them will make it look much more professional and engaging!
